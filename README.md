# Project-Pizza

The assignment was to practice basic JavaScript. And with that basic JavaScript build a simple page for a pizzeria, where you could order some food.

## The problem

I learned to use variables and conditionals. The first steps were quite simple but I struggled a bit with getting step 3 to work. And I'm guessing I could've used less code on that particular step.
When I have more time I'd like to try using the switch break structure. I'd also like to add a function that will send the user back to the last question if they write an invalid number, instead of just exiting the entire process.
