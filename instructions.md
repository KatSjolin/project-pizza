## Stretch Goals

So youâ€™ve completed all the steps above? Great job! Make sure you've committed and pushed a version of your project before starting on the stretch goals. Remember that the stretch goals are optional.

As a challenge to enhance your coding skills, consider refactoring the entire code by replacing the existing if, else-if, and else conditionals with a more streamlined and organized approach using JavaScript's switch case structure. By doing so, you'll improve code readability and maintainability, making it easier to manage various scenarios and outcomes in a more structured manner.

We recommend creating an extra `script.js` file under the name `switch.js` to have both code syntaxes available.

### How to approach the stretch goals:

- **Review the existing code:** Take a thorough look at your current code to understand the logic, conditions, and branches that determine the flow of the program based on user choices.
- **Identify cases:** Identify the different cases or options that lead to different actions or outcomes in the program. Each case should correspond to a specific choice the user makes.
- **Implement the switch statement:** Replace the existing if, else-if, and else statements with a switch statement. The switch statement allows you to evaluate a single expression against multiple possible case values.
- **Define cases:** For each case value, define the corresponding code block that should be executed when that case is matched.
- **Handle default case:** Include a default case to handle situations where none of the defined cases matches the expression. This serves as a catch-all to manage unexpected inputs.
- **Test and validate:** Thoroughly test your refactored code with various inputs to ensure that it behaves as expected and produces the correct outputs.

Refactoring the code using a switch case approach not only showcases your coding versatility but also contributes to writing cleaner and more efficient code. It's a valuable skill that can lead to more readable and maintainable programs in the long run.
